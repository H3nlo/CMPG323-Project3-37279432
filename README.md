# CMPG323-Project3-37279432

CMPG323-Project3-37279432 - This project involves working on an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application, where the task is to enhance and improve the application. This includes focusing on architectural patterns, implementing coding principles, and utilizing design patterns as required for the project.

Project Description:
This project is a web-based application designed for managing data related to Orders, Customers, and Products. It follows best practices in software development, including the use of a repository pattern for data access and secure hosting on Microsoft Azure. The project's primary goal is to provide a user-friendly and efficient way to handle various tasks related to these three main entities.
Managing Orders:
Users can manage Orders through the application, including creating new orders, editing existing ones, and marking orders as complete or shipped.
To create a new order, users should navigate to the Orders section, click on a "Create New Order" button, and fill in the necessary order details (e.g., customer, products, quantities).
To edit an order, users can select an existing order from the list, make the required changes, and save the modifications.
Managing Customers:
Users can manage Customers through the application, including adding new customers, updating customer information, and deleting customers if necessary.
To add a new customer, users should go to the Customers section, click on a "Create New Customer" button, and provide customer details (e.g., name, contact information).
To update customer information, users can select an existing customer from the list, make changes, and save.
Managing Products:
Users can manage Products, including adding new products, updating product details, and removing products from the system.
Adding a new product involves going to the Products section, clicking on a "Create New Product" button, and entering product details (e.g., name, price).
To update a product, users can select it from the list, make modifications, and save the changes.
